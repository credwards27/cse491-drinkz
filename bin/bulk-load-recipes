"""
This script bulk loads recipes from an XML file. It takes 2 arguments and is run as follows:

bulk-load-recipes [database file] [recipes xml file]

The database file is a prexisting saved database file that the recipes will be added to. It will be loaded into the
database before the recipes are parsed and added. After the database is loaded and the recipes have been added, the
database file will be overwritten to save the new recipes.
